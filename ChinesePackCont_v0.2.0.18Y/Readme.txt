Thank you for reading this Readme document, because most people don’t.

---Installation---
Extract the GameData folder into \KSP\GameData\. It’s recommended to MANUALLY delete ALL previous versions of the Chinese Pack, though your OS will probably tell you to replace them anyway. 
Extract ships folder into KSP directory if you want pre-build rockets (untested).

---Dependencies---
Community Resource Pack (Included)
Procedural Fairings (Will be one in the future, but not done by now)

---Known Issues---
Parachute problem on Shenzhou command pod, might work more normally under RealChute
- It only has the upper half visible, but does function normally (somewhat)

- Shenzhou command pod will slide sideway during parachuted descent

CZ-3 RP FX is buggy and needs some more work, thus it is disabled by default
Shenzhou orbital module's crew hatch is un-clickable (no menu popping up)
